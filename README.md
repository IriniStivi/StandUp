# StandUp
## A small app to ensure you don't sit all day.

Working at a height adjustable desk? Caught yourself again and again sitting more than half of your work day anyways?
Been there, too. But not for much longer!

**Just open it in a separate window and minimize it to a corner. It will remind you to stand up after a number of minutes you define at start.**

(The app plays sounds. These are not played on iOS devices. I don't think that's a problem, as I wrote it for the desk people folks sitting at a Mac, PC or Linux system.)
