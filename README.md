# StandUp
A small app to ensure you don't sit all day.
Just open it in a separate window and minimize it to a corner. It will remind you to stand up after a number of minutes you define at start.

The app plays sounds. These are not played on iOS devices. I don't think that's a problem, as I wrote it for the desk people folks sitting at a Mac, PC or Linux system.

The app is still new and under construction.
